# ⏰ Reminder – Smart Alert System!  

🎉 **This is my first ever web project!**  
Built with love and lots of JavaScript, this simple Reminder app lets you set a **title, description, and date-time** for important tasks—and gives you an **alert** just like those classic `alert("...")` pop-ups in JavaScript!

- ✅ Add a **Title** for your task  
- 📝 Add a **Description**  
- 📅 Set **Date & Time** for the reminder
